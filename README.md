### DATE: 9/09/2025                                                                          
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222060277
### AIM: 
To write a logic program for finding the factorial using SWI-Prolog
the factorial of given number using SWI-PROLOG
### Algorithm:
1. STEP 1: Start the program
2. STEP 2: Write a rules for finding factorial of given program in SWI-PROLOG.
3. a) factorial of 0 is 1 => written as factorial(0, 1).
4. b) factorial of number greater than 0 obtained by recursively calling the factorial function.
5. STEP 3: Run the program to find answer of query.
6. STEP 4: Stop the program.
### Program:
factorial(0,1).
factorial(A, B) :-
Α > 0,
Cis A-1,
Al Lab 2073 24 Nob
factorial (C,D),
B is AD.

### Result:
Thus the factorial of given number was found by logic programming.
